    The following targets can be provided to inject logic before and/or after key steps
    of the build process:

        The "init-local" target is used to initialize properties that may be personalized
        for the local machine.

            <target name="-before-init-local"/>
            <target name="-after-init-local"/>

        The "clean" target is used to clean build output from the build.dir.

            <target name="-before-clean"/>
            <target name="-after-clean"/>

        The general "init" target is used to initialize all other properties, including
        those provided by Sencha Cmd.

            <target name="-before-init"/>
            <target name="-after-init"/>
    
        The "page" target performs the call to Sencha Cmd to build the 'all-classes.js' file.

            <target name="-before-page"/>
            <target name="-after-page"/>

        The "build" target performs the call to Sencha Cmd to build the application.

            <target name="-before-build"/>
            <target name="-after-build"/>
